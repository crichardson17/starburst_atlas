Little emission (phi = 11, hdens = 2)
   Calculation stopped because lowest Te reached. Iteration 4 of 4
   The geometry is plane-parallel.
 C-Continuum zero at some energies.
 C-The Lya optical depth scale was overrun and this is the last iteration - Tspin(21 cm) is not valid.
 C-Another iteration is needed for Tspin(21 cm) to be valid.
  !Charge transfer ionization of H reached 2439.7% of the local H ionization rate.
  !Non-collisional excitation of [O III] 4363 reached 15.86% of the total.
  !AGE: Cloud age was not set.  Longest timescale was 2.20e+11 s = 6.98e+03 years.
  !Some infrared fine structure lines are optically thick:  largest tau was 1.24e+00
  !The CMB was not included.  This is added with the CMB command.
  !The radiation pressure jumped by 132% at zone 4, from 2.00e-13 to 3.64e-13 to 7.59e-13
   Charge transfer heating reached 1.32% of the local heating.
   The density is too low to l-mix the lowest H  I collapsed level.  More resolved levels are needed for accurate line ratios.
   The density is too low to l-mix the lowest He I collapsed level.  More resolved levels are needed for accurate line ratios.
   The largest continuum occupation number was 4.099e+00 at 1.004e-08 Ryd.
   Local grain-gas photoelectric heating rate reached  15.5% of the total.
   Global grain photoelectric heating of gas was  9.8% of the total.
   Local grain-gas cooling of gas rate reached   6.1% of the total.
   The Balmer continuum optical depth was 5.41e-01.
   The Balmer continuum stimulated emission correction to optical depths reached 1.38e-01.
   The Paschen continuum optical depth was 2.49e-01.
   The continuum optical depth at the lowest energy considered (1.004e-08 Ryd) was 4.450e+01.
   The ratio of radiation to gas pressure reached 5.32e-02 at zone 30.  Caused by Lyman alpha.

Normal emission (phi = 11, hdens = 4):
